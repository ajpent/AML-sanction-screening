# AML-sanction-screening

This project was done as an example how one might do sanction screening. In the project many different algorithms were tested. I chose the one because of its performance with the tokenization. Tokenization was deemed important because some foreign names include multipart surnames and simply by changing the order sanction screening can be avoided withou it.
